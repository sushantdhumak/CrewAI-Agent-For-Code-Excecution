# CrewAI Agent For Code Excecution

Welcome to the AgentForCodeExcecution Crew project, powered by [crewAI](https://crewai.com). This is to set up a multi-agent AI system with ease, leveraging the powerful and flexible framework provided by crewAI. Our goal is to enable the agents to collaborate effectively on complex tasks, maximizing their collective intelligence and capabilities.


## Running the Project

To kickstart the crew of AI agents and begin task execution, run this from the root folder of the project:

python .\src\agent_for_code_excecution\main.py

This command initializes the agent-for-code-excecution Crew, assembling the agents and assigning them tasks as defined in the configuration.


## Understanding Your Crew

The agent-for-code-excecution Crew is composed of an AI agent, with unique role, goal, and tools. This agent collaborate on a series of tasks, defined in `config/tasks.yaml`, leveraging collective skills to achieve complex objectives. The `config/agents.yaml` file outlines the capabilities and configurations of the agent in the crew.

As a Senior Data Analyst Specialist, the software_engineer agent will leverage Python programming expertise to collect, analyze, and interpret the dataset, delivering actionable insights and data-driven answers that address the specific question outlined in the agent tasks instructions.
